SIZED TYPES

  This is a header library for 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit sized types in ANSI C.
  It provides the following types:

    * int8
    * int16
    * int32
    * uint8
    * uint16
    * uint32

  It also includes the same macros for using these data types with printf as
  stdint.h provides (PRIu16, PRId32, etc...)

USAGE

  Download this project and add it to your CMakeLists.txt with the following
  line:

    add_subdirectory("/path/to/sized_types")

  After that, link it along with your other dependencies to your project
